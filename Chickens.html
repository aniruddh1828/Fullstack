        <p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red
                junglefowl</a> of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing
            meat
            and eggs;
            others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>


        <p> Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and
            an
            annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year.
            There
            are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most
                breeds,
                and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
                allow
                them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult
                chickens
                of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin
                on
                either
                side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a
                mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.<sup><a

        <h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <h4>Phylogeny</h4>
        <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often
            lowering
            the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds
            to
            his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in
            which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs
            off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the
            male does a tail-bending display.[33]</p>
